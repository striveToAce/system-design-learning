heartbeat message:
                mechanism: to check failed or crashed server in distributed system

AJAX Polling (short polling):
                client request - server response - can be empty or data
                client request repeatedly


AJAX Long Polling (long polling):
                client request - server response - cannot be empty
                server hold the request until data is ready
                client wait for response

WebSocket:
                duplex communication between server and client
                server can send message to client without client request
                client can send message to server without server request

SSE (Server-Sent Events): 
                client establish - long term connection where server can send message
                client cannot send on same connection - it need to use another connection or protocol


fundamentals of DS system:
                data durability, consistency
                replication
                paritioning
                consensus

consistency models:
                eventual consistency
                casual consistency
                sequential consistency
                strict consistency

type of failure:
                fail-stop
                crash
                ommision
                byzantine

Availability: - ((total time - downtime)/total time)*100

Reliability: - MTBF/MTTR - (mean time between failure/mean time to recovery)


Dimensions of scalability:
                Size
                administrative
                geographical

Maintainability: mean time to repair 
Reliability : mean time to repair and mean time to failure

Fault tolerance:
                replication
                checkpointing (consistent checkpointing, in-consistent checkpointing)
